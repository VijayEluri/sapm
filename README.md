Subversion Authentication Parser Module
=======================================

The idea is to read the [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn-book.html#svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz|authentication file of Subversion]
and convert it into a form which can be used inside an application.

This means to check a user against the configuration for example if a user is
allowed to read a particular path in a special repository or not.

Status
======
- Object model created and fit my needs.
- ANTLR Grammar works reading
- Combination of the above parts is not yet done.
